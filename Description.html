 		<dd>My personal favourite and most balanced marketplace in terms of jobs and competition. It is ideal for new freelancer and small startups to outsource their need as the competition is low and the freelancers are really economic. Along with this they charge a nominal fee of 8% on freelancer earnings, which is much less than the 20% other marketplaces charge. Truelancer doesnâ€™t charge any service fee for the employers.</dd>
