		Truelancer: My personal favourite and most balanced marketplace in terms of jobs and competition. It is ideal for new freelancer and small startups to outsource their need as the competition is low and the freelancers are really economic. Along with this they charge a nominal fee of 8% on freelancer earnings, which is much less than the 20% other marketplaces charge. Truelancer doesn‚Äôt charge any service fee for the employers.
		Toptal: If you are among the top developers on the planet and looking forward to start your freelance career, then this place is for you. Their is no competition on the platform, and the jobs are really good. For a client perspective I won‚Äôt advice you this platform unless you are having tons of investor‚Äôs money to burn on your project.
		PeoplePerHour: Aimed at web projects for marketers, SEO specialists, and software engineers, People Per Hour works to streamline the process of freelancing by organizing communication and payments as well as job management. Freelancers can send 15 proposals to clients for free before they will need to sign up for a paid plan, but freelancers can browse jobs and get notified for new openings at no cost. It is worth checking out for those who are focused on completing any type of web focused project
		UPWORK: This site boasts over 1.5 million clients, and there are jobs for every type of freelancer that you could imagine that last short term and long term. Work can be done as hourly or per project, and anyone whose skill level is entry level to expert can find something that fits their need. Because of the vast availability of work, it is likely that anyone can find work through this platform. When work is completed, funds are safely transferred from client to freelancer.
		FIVERR: This sort of works in the opposite way that traditional platforms do. Freelancers create their own jobs based upon what they are good at, rather than companies posting jobs that freelancers can apply for. Freelancers are able to market their services to companies, and are able to put their gigs into categories by using keywords that show up in different searches. The names comes from the idea that the freelancers will start their prices at $5 per project. This is not a requirement, just the starting point for their prices.
		FLEXJOBS: Browse through freelance and part-time work in a variety of career fields. All of the telecommuting jobs are screened, so that freelancers can feel confident that they are applying for a position at a legitimate company. Freelancers can also participate in skill tests, read up on tips for job searching, and members can get special discounts through partnering websites. Freelancers will have access to great resources like webinars, to learn how to land better clients.
		CROWDSOURCE: CrowdSource has been called one of the largest freelance teams available. It specializes in content creation, editing, and monitoring for online retailers, media companies, and publishers. What is unique is that the platform breaks the large tasks up into smaller more manageable tasks. Freelancers who are deemed to be qualified are able to work on these tasks through the integrated platform. If a freelancer's work is deemed to be good, they will receive a greater compensation and gain access to more work.
		FREELANCER: There are a few different working options including both hourly work as well as contests. Users are able to browse through the jobs that are a match with their skill level, and then apply to their chosen openings. There are over a million projects that need freelancers at any given time, so this is a great place to show off your talents and work to attract future clients.
		GURU: Show off your past work while being given access to new jobs every day. You will also be able to see how much a company has spent using Guru's freelancer pool‚Äîhelping to make a decision about whether or not the client will be a good match to your work. Choose jobs by location, category, or job type (hourly or fixed).
		Well, this is my pick for some best freelance websites. I must suggest that you check them all.Truelancer: My personal favourite and most balanced marketplace in terms of jobs and competition.
